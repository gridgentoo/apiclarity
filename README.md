# APIClarity

![APIClarity](API_clarity.svg "APIClarity")

Reconstruct [OpenAPI Specifications](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html)
from real-time workload traffic seamlessly.

## Microservices API challenges

- Not all applications have an OpenAPI specification available
- How can we get this for legacy or external applications?
- Detect whether microservices still use deprecated APIs (a.k.a. Zombie APIs)
- Detect whether microservices use undocumented APIs (a.k.a. Shadow APIs)
- Generate OpenAPI specifications without code instrumentation or
  modifying existing workloads (seamless documentation)

## Solution

- Capture all API traffic in an existing environment using multiple traffic sources
- Construct an OpenAPI specification by observing API traffic or upload a
  reference OpenAPI spec
- Review, modify and approve automatically generated OpenAPI specs
- Alert on any differences between the approved API specification and the API
  calls observed at runtime; detects shadow & zombie APIs
- UI dashboard to audit and monitor the findings

## Getting started

### Supported traffic source integrations
APIClarity supports integrating with the following traffic sources. Install APIClarity and follow the instructions per required integration.

* Istio Service Mesh
  * Make sure that Istio 1.10+ is installed and running in your cluster.
  See the [Official installation instructions](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/#install)
  for more information.

* Tap via a DaemonSet
  * [Integration instructions](https://github.com/openclarity/apiclarity/tree/master/plugins/taper)

* Kong API Gateway
  * [Integration instructions](https://github.com/openclarity/apiclarity/tree/master/plugins/gateway/kong)

* Tyk API Gateway
  * [Integration instructions](https://github.com/openclarity/apiclarity/tree/master/plugins/gateway/tyk)

The integrations (plugins) for the supported traffic sources above are located in the [plugins directory within the codebase](https://github.com/openclarity/apiclarity/tree/master/plugins) and implement the [plugins API](https://github.com/openclarity/apiclarity/tree/master/plugins/api) to export the API events to APIClarity. To enable and configure the supported traffic sources, please check the ```trafficSource:``` section in [Helm values](https://github.com/openclarity/apiclarity/blob/master/charts/apiclarity/values.yaml).
Contributions of integrations with additional traffic sources are more than welcome!

### Install APIClarity in a K8s cluster using Helm:

1. Add Helm repo

   ```shell
   helm repo add apiclarity https://openclarity.github.io/apiclarity
   ```
2. Save APIClarity default chart values
    ```shell
    helm show values apiclarity/apiclarity > values.yaml
    ```

3. Update `values.yaml` with the required traffic source values

4. Deploy APIClarity with Helm for the selected traffic source

   ```shell
   helm install --values values.yaml --create-namespace apiclarity apiclarity/apiclarity -n apiclarity
   ```

3. Port forward to APIClarity UI:

   ```shell
   kubectl port-forward -n apiclarity svc/apiclarity-apiclarity 9999:8080
   ```

4. Open APIClarity UI in the browser: <http://localhost:9999/>
5. Generate some traffic in the traced applications and check the APIClarity UI :)

### Uninstall APIClarity from a K8s cluster using Helm:

1. Helm uninstall
   ```shell
   helm uninstall apiclarity -n apiclarity
   ```
2. Clean resources

    By default Helm will not remove the PVCs and PVs for the StatefulSets. Run the following command to delete them all:

    ```shell
    kubectl delete pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=apiclarity -n apiclarity
    ```
## Configurations

The file [values.yaml](https://github.com/openclarity/apiclarity/blob/master/charts/apiclarity/values.yaml) is used to deploy and configure APIClarity on your cluster via Helm.
[This ConfigMap](https://github.com/openclarity/apiclarity/blob/master/charts/apiclarity/templates/configmap.yaml) is used to define the list of headers to ignore when reconstructing the spec.

## Testing with a demo application

A good demo application to try APIClarity with is the [Sock Shop Demo](https://microservices-demo.github.io/).

To deploy the Sock Shop Demo, follow these steps:

1. Create the `sock-shop` namespace and enable Istio injection:

   ```shell
   kubectl create namespace sock-shop
   kubectl label namespaces sock-shop istio-injection=enabled
   ```

2. Deploy the Sock Shop Demo to your cluster:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo/master/deploy/kubernetes/complete-demo.yaml
   ```

3. Deploy APIClarity in the `sock-shop` namespace (e.g. Istio service-mesh traffic source):
   ```shell
   helm repo add apiclarity https://openclarity.github.io/apiclarity
   ```
   ```shell
   helm install --set 'trafficSource.envoyWasm.enabled=true' --set 'trafficSource.envoyWasm.namespaces={sock-shop}' --create-namespace apiclarity apiclarity/apiclarity -n apiclarity
   ```

4. Port forward to Sock Shop's front-end service to access the Sock Shop Demo App:

   ```shell
   kubectl port-forward -n sock-shop svc/front-end 7777:80
   ```

   Open the Sock Shop Demo App UI in the browser (<http://localhost:7777/>) and run
   some transactions to generate data to review on the APIClarity dashboard.

## Building

### Building from source:
Build and push the image to your repo:

```shell
DOCKER_IMAGE=<your docker registry>/apiclarity DOCKER_TAG=<your tag> make push-docker
```
Update [values.yaml](https://github.com/openclarity/apiclarity/blob/master/charts/apiclarity/values.yaml) accordingly.

## Running locally with demo data

1. Build UI & backend locally as described above:

   ```shell
   make ui && make backend
   ```

2. Copy the built site:

   ```shell
   cp -r ./ui/build ./site
   ```

3. Run backend and frontend locally using demo data:
   
   Note: You might need to delete the old local state file and local db:
   ```shell
   rm state.gob; rm db.db
   ```
   ```shell
   DATABASE_DRIVER=LOCAL FAKE_TRACES=true FAKE_TRACES_PATH=./backend/pkg/test/trace_files \
   ENABLE_DB_INFO_LOGS=true ./backend/bin/backend run
   ```

4. Open APIClarity UI in the browser: <http://localhost:8080/>
